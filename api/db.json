It sits right down by Quincy Market, was originally Atwood & Bacon, and the original menu has a choice between Virginia, Narragansett, or Cape oysters. Plus clams from Ipswich. Its very helpful timeline points out that Daniel Webster used to hang there eating plate after plate of oysters while drinking brandy and water, and it also informs that toothpicks were first used in the US there, when a dude from Maine used to pay Harvard guys to eat there and request them. So yes, it's Union Oyster by a knockout. Please pay the waiter.",
